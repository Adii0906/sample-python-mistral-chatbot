## Creating an `.env` File for Storing API Keys

When working on projects that require sensitive information, such as API keys or secrets, it's essential to keep them secure. Here's how to create and use an `.env` file:

### Step 1: Install `python-dotenv` (if using Python)
If your project is Python-based, you'll need the `python-dotenv` library to load variables from the `.env` file.  
Run the following command to install it:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv

Create an .env File
touch .env

Add your sensitive keys and values in this format:
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Step 3: Use the .env File in Your Code
Load the variables from the .env file into your application. Example in Python:

python code
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Access variables
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
secret_key = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
print(f"API Key: {api_key}")

Step 4: Add .env to .gitignore
To ensure your .env file is not pushed to public repositories:

Open or create a .gitignore file in your project.
Add the following line:
bash
.env


4. **Start the Application**:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run App.py
   ```
